- Project objective:
  We want to test the hypothesis about whether national lockdown is more effective than regional lockdown, for recent pandemic Covid-19. We want to use the data that is available from John Hopkins University, and Wikipedia about the recently pandemid - Covid-19. Based on the deaths count and mortality rate per 100.000 populations, we then answer our Hypothesis whether, the national lockdown or regional lockdown will affect the mortality rate.

- Motivation:
  We just want to know about how dangerous this virus can cause. We hope to see that the data will provide a clear best practice for future pandemic or handeling reemergence of Covid-19. 

- Hypothesis tetsing:
  If countries implement a national lockdown, then mortality rate will be lesser than countries that implement a regional lockdown. 
  
- Dataset and clean up:
  We import the dataset into Python as csv files. We then drop out unnecessary rows, and columns. We also need to format the columns label to get a cleaner look. 
  We also found the lockdown level tabel from wikipedia.
  We then use some popular countries such as: United States, Russia, Italy, France, Australia, Liberia, Israel, Brazil and Germany
  We also created the dataframe that contains the population, deaths count and mortality rate per 100.000 populations.
- Graphing:
  We use line graphs for time-series dataset, to show the start date and end date of the lockdown and compare the mortality rates between national and regional.

- Limitation:
  As we used the dataset that is from 06/29/2020, so the rate will not be right at the moments, but it is a good indicator how dangerous the virus is. As of today, the mortality rate per 100.000 for the United States went up to 863.8 as calculated by CDC (https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/deaths.htm). This is a fast increasing rate.

  We also know that each country did lockdown differently, and each countries do have different medical system, so these factors may contribute to the change of the mortality rate in either way.
