- Project objective:
  We want to test the hypothesis about whether national lockdown is more effective than regional lockdown, for recent pandemic Covid-19. We use the data that is available from John Hopkins University, and Wikipedia about the recent pandemid. Based on the deaths count and mortality rate per 100.000 population, we then answer our Hypothesis whether the national lockdown or regional lockdown will affect the mortality rate per 100.000 population.

- Motivation:
  We just want to know about how dangerous this virus can cause. We hope to see that the data will provide a clear best practice for future pandemic or handeling reemergence of Covid-19. 

- Hypothesis tetsing:
  If countries implement a national lockdown, then mortality rate will be lesser than countries that implement a regional lockdown. 
  
- Dataset and clean up:
  We import the dataset into Python as csv files. We then drop out unnecessary rows, and columns. We also need to format the columns label to get a cleaner look. 
  We also found the lockdown level tabel from wikipedia.
  We then use some popular countries such as: United States, Russia, Italy, France, Australia, Liberia, Israel, Brazil and Germany
  We also created the dataframe that contains the population, deaths count and mortality rate per 100.000 populations.
- Graphing:
  We use line graphs for time-series dataset, to show the start date and end date of the lockdown and compare the mortality rates between national and regional.
- Conclusion
  We found that our hypothesis is not supported, due to some factors. As with the bar chart, can cause misunderstanding about the mortality rate per 100.000 population. For example, Italy has the mortality per 100.000 rate at 57.46 compared to the US at 38.29. Since Italy has the total population around 60 millions people, and the US around 328 millions people. But compared the deaths count for Italy around 34744 people, and the US around 126140 people. We can see some effects of the lockdown. 

- Limitation:
  As we used the dataset that is from 06/29/2020, so the rate will not be correct at the moments, but it is a good indicator how dangerous the virus is. As of today, the mortality rate per 100.000 for the United States went up to 863.8 as calculated by CDC (https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/deaths.htm). This is a fast increasing rate.

  We also know that each country did lockdown differently, and each countries do have different medical system, so these factors may contribute to the change of the mortality rate in either way. 
- Some considerations about our project:
  We understand that there will be limitations about our dataset, since it was chosen at specific date 06/29/2020, when we found the dataset. Until now, the data is obsolete, but it is a good starting point to look at how dangerous the disease is. 
  We also understand that the data may be driven by some other factors: political, medical systems, and also the technology systems of each countries. So the analysis maybe biased at some point.
  Wear mask, wash hands and stay home would help slow down the spread of the disease.
